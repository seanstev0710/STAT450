```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
starwars2 <- select(starwars, name, height, mass, homeworld, species)
starwars2
```

# Exercise 1

```{r}
# filter(starwars2, species = "Droid") ### Wrong logical operator used equality is ==
filter(starwars2, species == "Droid")
```

It returns an error because = is not an equality operation. == is used for equality operation

# Exercise 2

```{r}
filter(starwars2, species != "Human")
```

# Exercise 3

```{r}
filter(starwars2, (species != "Human") & (homeworld == "Tatooine"))
```

# Exercise 4

```{r}
arrange(starwars2, ... = mass)
```

# Exercise 5

```{r}
# What does this code do?
arrange(starwars2, species, height)
```

It arranges the rows of the dataframe by species first, then groups them orders by height within their species grouping
